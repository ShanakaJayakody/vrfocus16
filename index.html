            // Passage 1: The Year Without a Summer
            `The year 1816 is remembered by climatologists and historians alike as "The Year Without a Summer." Unseasonal weather patterns devastated harvests across the Northern Hemisphere, leading to widespread food shortages, price spikes, and civil unrest. Though initially inexplicable, the cause was eventually traced to the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in present-day Indonesia-one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. The eruption released vast amounts of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, creating a global haze that significantly reduced sunlight and lowered surface temperatures.\nIn North America and parts of Europe, snow fell in June, and frosts persisted into July. Crops failed en masse in countries like Ireland, where the potato crop was hit particularly hard, and in Switzerland, where famine conditions contributed to spikes in mortality. Notably, it was during this enforced indoor confinement at Lake Geneva that Mary Shelley began writing what would become Frankenstein, a detail often cited to show the indirect cultural impact of climatic anomalies.\nThe longer-term consequences of the 1816 disruption are harder to trace but potentially profound. Some economic historians suggest that the subsequent migration waves from Europe to the Americas-particularly between 1817 and 1821-were partly triggered by the lingering economic fallout of that failed agricultural year. Others caution that such inferences may conflate correlation with causation, given the already complex political and social factors at play following the Napoleonic Wars.`,
            // Passage 2: Bicycle Stability
            `The stability of a moving bicycle has traditionally been attributed to the gyroscopic effect-the resistance to directional change caused by the spinning wheels. When a rider leans, the angular momentum of the front wheel generates a corrective steering force (called gyroscopic precession) that turns the wheel in the direction of the lean, helping bring the bike back under the rider's centre of mass. This effect increases with speed, which is why moving bikes are easier to balance than stationary ones.\nHowever, in 2011, researchers constructed a custom bicycle with counter-rotating wheels, designed to cancel out the gyroscopic effect entirely. Surprisingly, the bike remained upright without a rider, provided it was rolling forward. This finding shifted attention toward another stabilising factor: trail. Trail refers to the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel falls behind the steering axis. Like a shopping trolley's front wheels, this offset causes the front wheel to automatically steer into the direction of a fall, restoring balance.\nWhile some early models suggested gyroscopic forces were sufficient for balance, modern understanding recognises that, while geometry is the most crucial factor, stability is not the result of any single mechanism. Geometry, mass distribution, speed, and even frame stiffness interact in complex ways. Among these, trail has gained renewed importance-though researchers still emphasise that no one variable tells the full story.`,
            // Passage 3: Medieval Drawbridges
            `Medieval castles often relied on drawbridges to defend their entrances. These drawbridges were typically raised and lowered by a system of pulleys and counterweights-a rudimentary but effective form of mechanical advantage. In some designs, the counterweight was fixed and buried underground in a pit below the winch housing, acting as a passive force against the pull of gravity. Others used movable stone blocks suspended from chains, allowing fine adjustments depending on the weight of the bridge or additional loads, such as carts or cavalry.\nThe engineering behind these systems allowed a relatively small team-sometimes just two individuals to lift bridges weighing upwards of a ton. Contemporary reconstructions suggest that the inclusion of counterweights reduced the effective load by as much as 75%, greatly extending the operational lifespan of the bridge's hinges and axles. However, documents from the 14th century also record failures of these systems due to war damage, poor weather, and rope degradation.\nInterestingly, the psychological impact of drawbridges was often as important as their physical function. Chronicles from the period describe attackers hesitating at the sight of a raised drawbridge, associating it with an unbreachable fortress, even when the rest of the defenses were modest. This perception may have exaggerated the military effectiveness of the mechanism far beyond its actual strength.`,
            // Passage 4: Gendered and Sexual Violence Rallies
            `Tens of thousands of men, women and children have marched across Australian capital cities and regional towns calling for determined action to end gendered and sexual violence.\nAdvocates say the issue was not properly addressed during the federal election campaign, with funding pledges "barely even hitting the sides". The No More: National Rally Against Violence saw attendees gather in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart and regional centres in between. Organiser Sarah Williams called for more funding, training, and law reform to combat violence.\n"We need to be able to stop it before it starts," she told a 2,000-strong crowd on the steps of Parliament House in Melbourne on Saturday.\n"We need more funding for primary prevention, more trauma-informed response training for police, increased crisis housing, bail law reform and uniform consent laws," she said. "Men listen to men we need more male role models out there," Williams said.\nConsent and healthy relationship education should be expanded to more schools with additional funding, and community sporting clubs and major codes could also play a role in reaching different generations, she said. A total of 128 women have been killed since January 2024, according to the Australian Femicide Watch website. It has also pledged to invest more funding to stop high-risk perpetrators through electronic monitoring.\nBut Moody said ministers and leaders needed to sit down with frontline services to figure out what works.\nSource:https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/rallies-against-gendered-and-sexual-violence-held-across-australia/rxhvn3han`

            { passageIndex: 0, text: "The author would most likely agree that the cultural impact of the 1816 climate anomaly was:", options: ["limited to the region most directly affected by Tambora's eruption.", "one of the few long-lasting effects of the volcanic eruption.", "made possible only because of extreme weather confinement.", "an indirect but noteworthy consequence of environmental disruption."], correctAnswer: "D", explanation: "The passage explicitly mentions Mary Shelley writing Frankenstein during her confinement due to the weather, citing it as an example of 'the indirect cultural impact of climatic anomalies'. This directly supports option D. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA) limited to the region most directly affected by Tambora's eruption: Incorrect because the cultural impact mentioned (Mary Shelley) occurred in Europe (Lake Geneva), while Tambora is in Indonesia. The passage also mentions widespread effects across the Northern Hemisphere. \nB) one of the few long-lasting effects of the volcanic eruption: Incorrect. The passage states the 'longer-term consequences... are harder to trace but potentially profound' and discusses migration waves as another potential long-term effect, implying there wasn't just one long-lasting effect. \nC) made possible only because of extreme weather confinement: While the confinement was a factor for Mary Shelley, the passage doesn't state this was the only reason or that all cultural impacts were solely due to confinement. It uses Shelley's example as 'a detail often cited to show the indirect cultural impact', suggesting it's an illustration, not an exclusive cause." },
            { passageIndex: 0, text: "Which of the following best describes the author's view on the link between climate events and migration?", options: ["Clear evidence shows that major climate disruptions drive long-term migration trends.", "While the theory is plausible, it remains open to debate due to overlapping historical factors.", "There is little evidence that migration patterns were influenced by environmental causes.", "Most economic historians believe that failed harvests were the sole driver of post-war migration."], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states, 'Some economic historians suggest that the subsequent migration waves... were partly triggered by the lingering economic fallout...' but immediately follows with, 'Others caution that such inferences may conflate correlation with causation, given the already complex political and social factors at play...'. This indicates a debate and complexity, aligning with option B. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA) Clear evidence shows that major climate disruptions drive long-term migration trends: Incorrect because the author presents the link as a suggestion by 'some economic historians' and highlights that 'others caution' against this view due to confounding factors. \nC) There is little evidence that migration patterns were influenced by environmental causes: Incorrect. The passage does present it as a theory ('some economic historians suggest'), so it's not accurate to say there's 'little evidence' discussed. \nD) Most economic historians believe that failed harvests were the sole driver of post-war migration: Incorrect. The passage only says 'some economic historians suggest' the fallout was 'partly triggered' by the agricultural year, not that most believe it was the sole driver. The caution about 'complex political and social factors' also contradicts this." },
            { passageIndex: 0, text: "What can most reasonably be inferred about the author's broader attitude toward historical interpretation?", options: ["They see value in linking cultural works to historical moments but caution against simplistic narratives.", "They believe history should focus only on measurable outcomes like death tolls and migrations.", "They see literature as irrelevant to historical causation.", "They consider environmental history more rigorous than political history."], correctAnswer: "A", explanation: "The author presents the link between Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the climate anomaly as an 'indirect cultural impact'. Later, when discussing migration, the author includes the perspective of historians who 'caution that such inferences may conflate correlation with causation, given the already complex political and social factors at play'. This suggests an appreciation for connections but a warning against oversimplification. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nB) They believe history should focus only on measurable outcomes like death tolls and migrations: Incorrect. The inclusion of the cultural impact of Mary Shelley's writing shows the author considers non-measurable outcomes relevant. \nC) They see literature as irrelevant to historical causation: Incorrect. The passage explicitly uses Mary Shelley's writing of Frankenstein as an example of 'indirect cultural impact of climatic anomalies', indicating literature is seen as relevant. \nD) They consider environmental history more rigorous than political history: Incorrect. The passage presents both environmental factors (volcanic eruption) and political/social factors (Napoleonic Wars) without suggesting one is inherently more rigorous. It actually highlights the complexity when these factors interact." },
            { passageIndex: 0, text: "Which of the following, if added to the passage, would most strengthen the author's implication that the Tambora eruption had global consequences?", options: ["A contemporary newspaper report describing cold weather in Indonesia in 1816.", "Evidence that sulfur particles from Tambora were found in Greenland ice cores.", "A study showing that volcanoes can affect weather for several months.", "A statement from a historian linking Tambora to the fall of the Qing dynasty."], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states the eruption released sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, creating a 'global haze'. Finding sulfur particles from Tambora in Greenland, a location distant from Indonesia and affected by the global atmospheric circulation, would provide direct physical evidence of this global distribution and thus strengthen the claim of global consequences. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA) A contemporary newspaper report describing cold weather in Indonesia in 1816: This would indicate local effects, not necessarily global ones. Indonesia was the site of the eruption. \nC) A study showing that volcanoes can affect weather for several months: The passage already implies this with 'The Year Without a Summer' and its description of prolonged effects. This option doesn't specifically strengthen the global aspect as much as B. \nD) A statement from a historian linking Tambora to the fall of the Qing dynasty: While potentially showing a significant consequence, this is an interpretation. Option B provides physical evidence of the global spread of eruption material, which is a more direct strengthener of the global consequences claim made by the author regarding the haze." },
            { passageIndex: 1, text: "Based on the passage, which of the following best explains why the gyroscopic effect becomes more noticeable at higher speeds?", options: ["The spinning wheel begins to act like a stabilizer bar.", "Faster rotation increases angular momentum, making the stabilizing force stronger.", "The rider applies more corrective balance as they ride faster.", "The bicycle's geometry becomes less important at higher velocities."], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states, 'When a rider leans, the angular momentum of the front wheel generates a corrective steering force (called gyroscopic precession)... This effect increases with speed...'. This directly links increased speed to a stronger gyroscopic effect due to increased angular momentum. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. The spinning wheel begins to act like a stabilizer bar: The passage doesn't make this comparison or mention stabilizer bars.\nC. The rider applies more corrective balance as they ride faster: While a rider does balance, the question is about the gyroscopic effect itself. The passage attributes the increased effect to the wheel's physics, not primarily the rider's increased effort in this context. \nD. The bicycle's geometry becomes less important at higher velocities: The passage states that 'geometry is the most crucial factor' and that various elements 'interact in complex ways'. It doesn't suggest geometry becomes less important at higher speeds." },

'Surprisingly, the bike remained upright without a rider, provided it was rolling forward'. This directly challenges the necessity of the gyroscopic effect for stability. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. It proved that rider balance is unnecessary for bicycle stability: The experiment showed the bike remained upright 'without a rider' under specific conditions, suggesting rider input isn't always necessary for self-stability, but this wasn't the primary or sole conclusion about rider balance in general. The core finding was about the gyroscopic effect. \nB. It demonstrated that gyroscopic forces are the only contributor to bicycle stability: This is the opposite of what the experiment showed. It demonstrated stability without the gyroscopic effect, thus showing it's not the only contributor. \nD. It showed that bicycles without moving wheels can still be stable: The experiment involved the bike 'rolling forward', meaning the wheels were moving." },

It also discusses the roles of both gyroscopic effect and trail (a geometric factor). This supports the idea that geometry is key, but multiple factors are involved. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. While trail geometry is a factor, angular momentum is ultimately the primary reason bikes stay upright: The passage highlights the 2011 experiment which minimized gyroscopic effects (related to angular momentum) yet the bike remained stable, and states geometry is 'most crucial'. \nC. Rider skill is the most reliable predictor of whether a bicycle remains stable: The passage focuses on the physics of the bicycle itself (gyroscopic effect, trail, geometry, mass distribution) more than rider skill, especially when discussing the riderless experiment. \nD. Stability is entirely a consequence of the wheelbase length and mass distribution: While mass distribution is mentioned as a factor, wheelbase length is not specifically highlighted as the entire cause. The passage emphasizes a complex interaction of multiple factors including geometry (trail), gyroscopic effects, speed, and frame stiffness." },

This describes a caster mechanism where the wheel trails behind the pivot, allowing it to self-align. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. Trolley wheels also use angular momentum to resist turning: The passage uses the trolley analogy to explain trail, not the gyroscopic effect (which is related to angular momentum). \nB. The front wheels of a trolley are heavier to keep it stable: The passage doesn't mention the weight of trolley wheels as the reason for the analogy. The analogy is about the steering behavior due to the offset. \nC. Unlike bikes, trolleys rely on the rider's force for balance: The analogy is used to explain a self-stabilizing feature (trail), not a reliance on rider force for balance. The passage even mentions the experimental bike (utilizing trail) remaining upright without a rider." },
            { passageIndex: 2, text: "In the best-preserved medieval drawbridges, counterweights were always stored underground.", options: ["True", "False", "Can't tell"], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states, 'In some designs, the counterweight was fixed and buried underground... Others used movable stone blocks suspended from chains...'. The use of 'some' and 'others' indicates that underground storage was not the only method, therefore not 'always' the case, even in well-preserved ones (the passage doesn't specifically link preservation status to storage method exclusively). \nWhy A and C are incorrect: 'True' is incorrect because multiple designs existed. 'Can't tell' is incorrect because the passage provides enough information to determine that it wasn't always underground." },

It also mentions these systems used 'pulleys and counterweights-a rudimentary but effective form of mechanical advantage'. \nWhy B and C are incorrect: 'False' is directly contradicted by the text. 'Can't tell' is incorrect as the passage explicitly supports this statement." },
            { passageIndex: 2, text: "The inclusion of counterweights made the bridge's axle and hinge systems more susceptible to breaking under pressure.", options: ["True", "False", "Can't tell"], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states, 'Contemporary reconstructions suggest that the inclusion of counterweights reduced the effective load by as much as 75%, greatly extending the operational lifespan of the bridge's hinges and axles'. This means counterweights reduced stress, not increased susceptibility to breaking. \nWhy A and C are incorrect: 'True' is the opposite of what the passage states. 'Can't tell' is incorrect as the passage directly addresses the effect of counterweights on hinges and axles." },
            { passageIndex: 2, text: "Contemporary beliefs about the strength of a raised drawbridge often exaggerated its true defensive value.", options: ["True", "False", "Can't tell"], correctAnswer: "A", explanation: "The passage notes, 'Chronicles from the period describe attackers hesitating at the sight of a raised drawbridge, associating it with an unbreachable fortress, even when the rest of the defenses were modest. This perception may have exaggerated the military effectiveness of the mechanism far beyond its actual strength'. \nWhy B and C are incorrect: 'False' is contradicted by the text. 'Can't tell' is incorrect because the passage provides a clear statement about this perception." },

These are systemic solutions aimed at prevention and better response systems rather than solely treating harm after it occurs. The author presents these views without contradiction. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. The government does not care about women rights and domestic violence: While advocates state the issue wasn't 'properly addressed' and funding pledges were insufficient, this doesn't equate to the author definitively stating the government 'does not care.' The passage also mentions a government pledge to invest more funding in one area. \nB. That men are disenchanted with feminist movements: The passage mentions 'Tens of thousands of men, women and children' marched and Sarah Williams says, 'Men listen to men we need more male role models out there', implying a need for male involvement, not necessarily disenchantment with feminism itself. \nD. The protest was unsuccessful: The passage describes the rallies occurring and the demands made. It doesn't provide an assessment of its success or failure." },
            { passageIndex: 3, text: "According to the passage, why did Williams call for more men to be part of the protests?", options: ["Because it would encourage more men to listen to the issue of domestic violence.", "So that men could be held more accountable during the protest.", "Because it would provide a powerful symbol of men and women working together under the umbrella of feminism.", "To give their protest more logos and validity."], correctAnswer: "A", explanation: "Sarah Williams is directly quoted: ''Men listen to men we need more male role models out there,' Williams said'. This directly supports the idea that male involvement can help other men engage with the issue. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nB. So that men could be held more accountable during the protest: The passage doesn't state this as the reason. The focus of her quote is on men influencing other men. \nC. Because it would provide a powerful symbol of men and women working together under the umbrella of feminism: While this might be a byproduct, Williams' stated reason is specifically about men listening to other men. \nD. To give their protest more logos and validity: The passage doesn't mention logos (logical appeal) or validity in this context. The rationale provided by Williams is about peer influence among men." },
            { passageIndex: 3, text: "Which of the following matches the impact of the recent \"federal election campaign\" on the protests?", options: ["Its lack of discussion surrounding domestic violence deflated \"The No More\" rally.", "It reinforced the feeling of disenchantment among women at the rally with the government, making them more passionate.", "The positive changes mentioned encouraged women to come out in support of the government.", "It made the rally a political campaign stunt rather than an actually meaningful event."], correctAnswer: "B", explanation: "The passage states, 'Advocates say the issue was not properly addressed during the federal election campaign, with funding pledges 'barely even hitting the sides''. This lack of adequate address and funding would likely fuel frustration and reinforce a desire for change among protesters, making them more passionate in their demands. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. Its lack of discussion surrounding domestic violence deflated \"The No More\" rally: The passage indicates 'tens of thousands' marched, suggesting the opposite of deflation. The campaign's perceived inadequacy likely motivated people. \nC. The positive changes mentioned encouraged women to come out in support of the government: The passage highlights that advocates felt the issue was not properly addressed and funding was insufficient, making this option unlikely. \nD. It made the rally a political campaign stunt rather than an actually meaningful event: The passage portrays the rally as a genuine call for action by advocates and attendees, not a stunt. The criticism is directed at the election campaign's handling of the issue." },

The statistic of 128 women killed is presented in the context of these calls for preventative action, implying that with better systems and interventions (which are deemed lacking), such deaths could potentially be avoided. \nWhy others are incorrect:\nA. The issue of domestic violence is an unchanging one that has not improved over the last few centuries: The passage discusses current events (recent election, rallies) and calls for change, but it doesn't provide a historical comparison over centuries to suggest it's 'unchanging.' \nC. The government is working closely with those dealing directly with the issue to seek out new solutions: The passage includes a quote from Moody saying 'ministers and leaders needed to sit down with frontline services to figure out what works', which implies this close collaboration may not be happening sufficiently or at all, rather than stating it is happening. \nD. Action, rather than discussion, is the key for change here: While the rallies are a form of action and call for further 'determined action', the passage also details discussions, demands for funding, and calls for leaders to 'sit down with frontline services', suggesting both action and constructive discussion/planning are needed. The phrase 'key for change' is a strong claim, and while action is vital, the passage doesn't explicitly downplay the role of discussion in achieving that action. However, B is more directly supported by the emphasis on prevention." },
